Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  root 'home#index'


  # Example of regular route:

    # get 'creatures/new' => 'creatures#new'
    # post 'creatures' => 'creatures#create'
    # get 'creatures/create' => 'creatures#show'
    # get 'creatures' => 'creatures#index'

  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
    resources :creatures

    get "creatures/tag/:tag"  => "creatures#tag", as: :creaturetag

    get "tags/new" => "tags#new"
    post "tags" => "tags#create"
    get "tags/index" => "tags#index"
    resources :tags, only: [:index, :destroy]

    # resources :tags
    # get "newtag" => "tags#new"

    get '*path', to: "application#not_found" # you could do redirect_to => '404.html' but it doesn't render as error with search crawlers

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'
  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
end
